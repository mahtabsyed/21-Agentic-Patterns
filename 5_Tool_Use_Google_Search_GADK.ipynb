    "- Now let's see how to use pre-built tools in Google ADK.\n",
    "- First example is with Google Search pre-built tool. The google_search tool enables the agent to conduct web searches via Google Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Google ADK code sets up a basic agent capable of performing web searches. It defines a basic_search_agent, assigning it a Gemini model and the pre-built Google Search tool. The necessary ADK session and runner services are initialized to manage the agent's execution. A helper function call_agent is used to simulate a user query being sent to the runner. When executed, the agent processes the query, uses the Google Search tool to find information online, and provides a final response based on the search results."
